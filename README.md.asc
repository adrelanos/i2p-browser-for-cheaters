# i2p-browser-for-cheaters
The path of least resistance to a Linux-only i2p browser. Modifies a tor browser
and spits out a tar.gz.

In the spirit of this being a total rip-off, here's the story of a nameless
hero.

        The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by
        simply hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub-Meson Brain to
        an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian Motion producer
        (say a nice hot cup of tea) were of course well understood â€” and such
        generators were often used to break the ice at parties by making all the
        molecules in the hostess's undergarments leap simultaneously one foot
        to the left, in accordance with the theory of indeterminacy.

        Many respectable physicists said that they weren't going to stand for
        this, partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because
        they didn't get invited to those sorts of parties.

        Another thing they couldn't stand was the perpetual failure they
        encountered while trying to construct a machine which could generate
        the infinite improbability field needed to flip a spaceship across the
        mind-paralyzing distances between the farthest stars, and at the end of
        the day they grumpily announced that such a machine was virtually
        impossible.

        Then, one day, a student who had been left to sweep up after a
        particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoning in this way: If,
        he thought to himself, such a machine is a virtual impossibility, it
        must have finite improbability. So all I have to do in order to make
        one is to work out how exactly improbable it is, feed that figure into
        the finite improbability generator, give it a fresh cup of really hot
        tea... and turn it on!

        He did this and was rather startled when he managed to create the long
        sought after golden Infinite Improbability generator. He was even more
        startled when just after he was awarded the Galactic Institute's Prize
        for Extreme Cleverness he was lynched by a rampaging mob of respectable
        physicists who had realized that one thing they couldn't stand was a
        smart-arse.
