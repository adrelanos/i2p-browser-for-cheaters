Updates only change the delta (actual changes, not resending all
files).\
So this may or may not be the case when meek gets updated.

I don’t see why meek should be deleted - never caused an issue in
Whonix.

I think my early impulse was to try and remove Tor-specific features,
but since doing that seems pointless(Now that what it produces works)
I’d rather not have something added back in by an update without a user
knowing. I’ve changed it to leave the meek profile in now.

My Whonix development experience lets me conclude, it’s best to keep
the\
Tor Browser folder unmodified and to use environment variables to\
reconfigure Tor Browser to do what it should. Everything else is\
unreliable long term. And in the absence of environment variables, work\
with Tor Project to get them implemented, possibly submit patches.

Since you’re possibly going to modify tb-starter `/usr/bin/torbrowser`
(\
<https://phabricator.whonix.org/T795#16085> ), I think modifying the\
environment variable would be better.

[@eyedeekay](/u/eyedeekay){.mention} You guys have made some great
progress since I was last here. Thanks for putting your backs into it.
IMHO the best way forward, with least maintenance and breakage is to
leave Tor Browser extensions and updater alone and do the absolute
minimum that gets us up and running as long as they don’t mess with I2P
functionality - Which I don’t think they do?

Has anyone tried to update it with our Tor Browser Downloader script and
see if the prefs stay set?

Also speaking of updating I think its very important to have Tor Browser
Downloader somehow trigger on startup of TBB I2P to check for new
versions since this custom version is incapable of connecting to the the
internet? Its very important users have the latest fixes for obvious
reasons. [@Patrick](/u/patrick){.mention} can this be easily done if its
the case?

The easiest solution I can think of is to append a command to run TBB
DLer, in the custom TBB menu icon.

for example:

custom torbrowser u% && run TBB DLer

A user would have to go out of their way to not run an update check.

For this to be seamless as possible:

1.  TBB Downloader needs to be able to check the version of the locally
    installed TBB - this can be done because there is a version.js
    capability implemented in Tor Browser that can be queried IIRC.\
    EDIT:\
    <https://github.com/micahflee/torbrowser-launcher/pull/308>\
    Since TBB lacks a metadata file and parsing prefs.js for version
    info is bad practice, the best way is to read the changelog text
    file and go from there:\
    <https://github.com/micahflee/torbrowser-launcher/pull/307>

2.  TBB Downloader should run in a background mode and only show a
    prompt if installed version is less than a newer one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

While testing now: It seems other config settings are persistent,
however disabling the socks proxy (to prevent normal internet access) is
rolled back after a TBB update. Do you have a suggestion on how to keep
it off permanently?

`&&` would result in running `update-torbrowser` when `torbrowser`\

OK before I open tickets with the proposals, there is another idea:

Have a script that monitors changes to changelog.txt and trigger an 1.
overwrite of the custom TBB folder with the updated code if it detects
changes in TBB original, 2. Run the I2P pref script to re-apply those
settings after the code update.

Which one do you think is better?

I’ve been reading through the tb-updater and tb-starter scripts, and I
have a pretty good idea of how to make the changes we need to make to
make them set up an i2p browser also. I’ll watch the proposals and try
and implement them this weekend. It’ll also help me identify whether
there are any needed modifications I can’t make in TBB with environment
variables, but most of them already seem to be where I need them. I was
thinking just an “–i2p” flag for each of them, which would tell
tb-updater download the latest TBB to a different path and tell
tb-starter to use that TBB and assure i2p-related settings. Unless I’m
missing something that should be something I can do by Monday.

Actually these last couple of proposals are a workaround for the fact
that we can’t get privoxy’s domain whitelist feature off the ground.
This is by far the better solution as we can still update normally but
not users visit internet sites by mistake.
[@Goldstein](/u/goldstein){.mention} any luck doing this?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now [@Goldstein](/u/goldstein){.mention} add the whitelist instructions
to your github page:

In /etc/privoxy/config uncomment the line below and then restart
privoxy:

trustfile trust

Edit the newly created file:

kdesudo kwrite /etc/privoxy/trust

Add this rule rules at the end of the file then restart privoxy:

\~\*.i2p

Now it should block access and display a big red “UNTRUSTED” warning
whenever connecting to a non whitelisted domain (with the caveat that
you can override it if you press the go there anyway link but I assume
the user is not retarded). Tor Browser updater can connect no problem.

N.B. This is not effective for https links. To block those change the
setting below in about:config:

network.proxy.ssl;127.0.0.1\
network.proxy.ssl\_port;8118

Also might as well set privoxy for ftp proxying too.

Now it will say proxy refusing connections. I think
[@eyedeekay](/u/eyedeekay){.mention}’s choice to set all the protocols
(ftp, ssl, http) to 127.0.0.1:8118 was a more sound choice because
‘share settings’ doesn’t seem effective. Can you also add this to
github?

There is still hope. To filter ssl we can can use stunnel. Unfortunately
squid is not an option because to enable sslbump support we would need
to recompile the deb src package since the default binary does not have
these options enabled.

This is more complicated than I thought with not much instructions on
the web. The closest thing I have is this discussion though its not

What we want is to MITM SSL connections and pipe the output into privoxy

Well it was really just a matter of what I started with and what I left
in when I re-activated Torbutton. The reason I originally regarded what
I did as “cheating” was that my original intent was to apply [these
settings](https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pdbrowser/blob/master/linux/build/preferences/syspref.js)
to a current Tor Browser in order to produce an acceptable basic i2p
Browser. Then I realized Torbutton configured most of those by default
and removed all but the proxy-setting preferences, and leaving them all
explicit seemed like the careful thing to do. I’ve added that back into
the script. This is simple enough to maintain and useful to me, so I’m
going to keep it maintained, but if I can I’d like to move to modifying
the tb-updater to set up a Tor Browser especially for use with a
modified proxy(i2p or privoxy, etc), and either modifying or imitating
tb-starter to configure and launch it. That way the behavior is
consistent and we can sidestep some of the update issues. I’ll just make
it so they have a common configuration file with the desired settings.

Yea. Environment variables everywhere already. Fore-planed modification\

Yes, it could have a flag --i2p which runs a function which then sets\
the variables.

Imitating tb-starter doesn’t sound so great. Modification should be

I thought on it some more & I don’t feel comfortable fucking with Tor
Browser’s updater SSL with stunnel. They are probably checking code sigs
too but still. Yet another probably impractical solution is to
“virtualize” the original TBB. Essentially every time you launch the
custom Bundle, the original is copied to the custom folder, a script
applies the custom prefs including the SSL blocking, bookmarks and so
on. Then on exit the entire custom TBB folder is deleted. The advantage
is you are guaranteed to be running the latest TBB version despite
internet access blocked, also its way more easier than modifying the Tor
downloader script to keep track of versions, perform the updates and
then restore our custom settings that disable socks access. The
disadvantage is it could be slower to start.

If this too sounds too much then I say we forget about blocking internet
access and save everyone’s time. Let’s assume a non-disciplined user is
not really our problem.

See *bold*. Why would the version be up to date? The user would have to\
interact with the “virtual” (or call it template?) TBB’s gui internal\
updater. Then the user would have to close TBB so the starter could
make\
a copy of it, modify, and start it.
